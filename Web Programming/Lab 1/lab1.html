                Cats are one of human's closest companions (though they would not seem to agree). Thus, I have decided to present to the world my very own companion, my very own Russian Blue legend, his name is Oscar! in here, we shall talk about his coming-of-age story, his overall personality and all sorts of feline-related stuff.

                <p>First of all, we should get accustomed Oscar's little story.</p>
                <p>We adopted this little fellow about one year ago. It was a very impulsive decision and we would not expect how much of a change it would make in our lives, just having another living being roam around the house and follow us and play. At that time, I was not at home, so my parents had to go through all the different cat-owner phases:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            showering him with toys that he likes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            after a week he stops liking them
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            buying him more toys on christmas...
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ...that he never <u>ONCE</u> plays with them
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Him finding his one true passion in life: sleep!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Him finding about his other big interest: BITING AND SCRATCHING
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>The rest might as well be history. Even though owning a pet is always a challenge in responsibility and affection, we have no regrets in living with such a majestic creature</p>
